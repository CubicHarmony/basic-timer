# basic-timer
My custom shell script for timing purposes! Looks even better with termdown installed.

# Installation
Clone the repository and then run <code>./install.sh</code>

# Usage
Best explained through example:
<code>timer 5m</code>
Starts timer for 5 minutes
Similar for 5s (seconds), 5h (hours), 5d (days)
Only takes in one parameter, very simple
