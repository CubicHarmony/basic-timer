# basic-timer
My custom shell script for timing purposes! Looks even better with termdown installed.

# Installation
Clone the repository and then run <code>./install.sh</code>

# Usage
Best explained through example:
<code>timer 5m</code> <br />
Starts timer for 5 minutes <br />
Similar for 5s (seconds), 5h (hours), 5d (days), etc <br />
Only takes in one parameter, might add additional arguments in the future.
